First leaf: at bottom it\nreads, in pencil: \u201cCollated Sep 1866[;] Richard Smythe Ne. a. Prof. Orient Lit.\nLond and y.\u201d The rest of the leaves are entirely blank.\nSub-total: 6 (front) + 4.5 back. 10.5 leaves; 21 pages.\nText sub-total: 213 leaves, 426 pages.\nUV (MS pages, not ours): 72r\u2014much rubrication, but not necessary to UV. 162r.\nInteresting or significant material: text begins at Matt 18:15. Many repairs made to the\ntext, both parchment leaves and paper. No paragraph breaks; very thick nib was used to\nwrite this. Matt ends on 13b. Mark\u2019s table of contents on 14a; Mark begins on 14b. Mark\nends on 35a; Luke\u2019s pinax begins on 35a. Lk begins on 36a. 43a lists lectionary reading\nin margin. Some variants or at least marginalia are noted throughout. Leaf count in Greek\ngiven at bottom of several rectos. 52v, 59v, 62v, 68v blank. Some rubrication. Quires\nseem to have outside leaves of parchment, inside leaves of paper. If so, quires include\nonly five double leaves (e.g., 76\u201380 is a quire, only 76 and 80 being of parchment).\nChapter numbers in margin, in Greek. In many, if not most, leaves one can see how often\nthe scribe dipped his pen. Quite a contrast in the ink from the beginning to end (leaves\n88, 89 are a good illustration). Paul after Gospels, then Acts and Catholics. Romans starts\non 97r. Has the subjunctive ecwmen in Rom 5.1. 108v begins 1 Cor. It looks as though the\ntop of the MS was trimmed, since the headings are often, if not usually, cut in half\nhorizontally. 2 Cor begins on 119r. Gal on 126v. Eph on 130r. Phil on 134r. Col on 136v.\n1 Thess starts on 139r. 2 Thess on 141v. 1 Tim on 143r. 2 Tim on 146r. Titus on 148r.\nPhlm on 149v. Heb on 150r. 160r concludes Heb. 160v begins a new hand, more petite\n(but using the same pen). bioV or hypotheses on 160v through 161v. 162r first hand again.\n162r begins Acts. 180r marginal note on reading in the text (at Acts 19.40 [though\nmarginal heading lists the second line after this as ch. 20]). Scrivener wrote a note in\npencil here on the reading peri ou [ou]: \u2018a stupid alteration by some modern reader\u2014.\u2019\nHe\u2019s commenting on the deletion of the ou jwhich was done in pen. Jas begins on 190r. 1\nPeter on 193r. 2 Peter on 196r. 198r 1 Jn. 201r has 2 Jn and 3 Jn. 201v has Jude (partial;\nleaf cuts off with no more text in mid-word). 203r has marginal note in pencil mentioning\nS. P. Tregelles. Rev is incomplete.\nTrapezoidal book.\nSeptember 1st, 2008: dbw"
